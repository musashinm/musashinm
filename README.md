## Hello, my friend. Stay a while and listen! ðŸ‘‹

I've been working with IT since 1999 as a developer. 

During this time, I had the opportunity to work for some big Brazilian companies, such as Officer Distribuidora, Meta IT, and NZN, and with big customers, such as Bovespa (former stock market maintainer; it's now part of B3), Bradesco (bank), and SESC-SP (private social service organization).

Currently, I'm working as a back-end developer at HG Insights.
